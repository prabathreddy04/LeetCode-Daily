## Intuition
The goal is to transform the array into a strictly increasing sequence by subtracting a prime number from specific elements. We start from the end of the array and look for the largest prime number that, when subtracted, makes the current element smaller than the next one. This ensures that the array remains strictly increasing.

## Approach
1. **Iterating from the back**: Begin by iterating through the array from the second-last element (index `n-2`) to the first element (index `0`).

2. **Checking for increase**: For each element `nums[i]`, check if it's already smaller than `nums[i+1]`. If `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`, no operation is needed, so we move to the next element.

3. **Finding the prime to subtract**: If `nums[i] >= nums[i+1]`, we need to find a prime number that, when subtracted from `nums[i]`, results in a value smaller than `nums[i+1]`.

4. **Helper function**: Use the helper function `func` to find the largest prime that satisfies `a - prime < b`, where `a = nums[i]` and `b = nums[i+1]`.

5. **Breaking the loop if no valid prime**: If no prime number satisfies the condition, return `false` because it's impossible to make the array strictly increasing.

6. **Return true if all elements are adjusted**: If we manage to adjust all elements such that the array is strictly increasing, return `true`.

## Complexity
### Time complexity:
- Checking if a number is prime takes \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) time.
- Overall, the time complexity for adjusting the array is \( O(n \times \sqrt{m}) \), where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `m` is the magnitude of the elements.

### Space complexity:
- The space complexity is \( O(1) \), as only a few variables are used during iteration and primality checking.
