# Explanation
## Intuition
The goal is to create an array of increasing numbers such that when we perform an AND operation on all of them, the result is x. We also need to find the smallest possible last number in this sequence.

## Approach
We start by identifying all bit positions where x has 0s (we'll store these positions in a vector named vec). For example, if x = 4 (which is 100 in binary), the positions with 0s are at bits 0 and 1. After this, we also add the higher bit positions (from 32 to 63) to ensure that we have enough bit spots to work with.

## Main Logic
We start with x as our minimum value.
We use the remaining count n-1 (in binary form) to determine where to place additional 1s in the available bit positions found earlier.
This ensures two things:

The numbers we generate can be arranged in increasing order.
The AND operation of all these numbers will result in x.
Finally, the solution returns the minimum possible last number in the array.
