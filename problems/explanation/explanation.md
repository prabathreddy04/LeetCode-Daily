## Intuition
Imagine you have two trees and you are wondering if they are "flip equivalent." This means:

1. The trees could either be exactly the same (i.e., no flipping needed), or
2. They could become the same if we flip (swap) the left and right subtrees at some nodes.

You can think of this process as comparing the two trees level by level. For each pair of nodes (one from each tree), you ask:

- **Are these two nodes identical?** (Do they have the same value?)
- **If not, can I swap their left and right children to make them look the same?**

If you can make the trees identical by flipping some nodes, they are flip equivalent. If not, they are not flip equivalent.

## Approach

### Base Cases:
1. **Both trees are empty (null):**
   - If both trees are empty at the same place, they are trivially equivalent, so return `true`.
2. **One tree is empty and the other is not:**
   - If one of the trees has a node, but the other is empty, they are clearly not equivalent, so return `false`.
3. **Different node values:**
   - If the nodes have different values, the trees cannot be equivalent, so return `false`.

### Recursive Comparison:
Now, we recursively check both the left and right children of the current nodes in both trees.

#### We have two main cases to check:

1. **No flip needed:**
   - If the left child of one tree matches the left child of the other tree, and the right child matches the right child, then no flip is needed, and we continue comparing their respective children.

2. **Flip needed:**
   - If the left child of one tree matches the right child of the other tree (and vice versa), we need to flip the children of one of the trees and continue comparing.
