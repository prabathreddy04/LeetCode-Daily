### Problem Intuition:
You have a list of folder paths and want to remove subfolders. If a folder is a subfolder of another folder already included in the result (for example, `/a/b` is a subfolder of `/a`), you should exclude the subfolder from the result.

### Approach:
The solution involves sorting the folders to facilitate an easier comparison and then iterating over them while keeping track of which folders should be included (i.e., non-subfolders).

### Key Steps in the Approach:

1. **Lexicographical Sort**:
   - First, sort the list of folder paths lexicographically (i.e., alphabetical order). This ensures that any subfolder will always appear after its parent folder. For example, `/a` will always come before `/a/b`.
   - This helps in efficiently comparing each folder with previously considered folders.

2. **Stable Sort by Length**:
   - After lexicographical sorting, the code uses `stable_sort` to ensure folders with shorter paths (e.g., `/a`) come before longer ones (e.g., `/a/b/c`). This makes sure that parent folders appear before their subfolders.
   - The sorting is stable, meaning if two strings have the same length, their relative order from the previous lexicographical sort will be maintained.

3. **Tracking Folders with a Set**:
   - An `unordered_set` is used to store the folders that have been included in the result. This allows for efficient lookups when checking if a folder is a subfolder of any previously considered folder.

4. **Processing Each Folder**:
   - For each folder `i`, you build its potential subfolders step by step by examining the folder path from left to right.
   - As you iterate over the folder characters, you form subfolder strings (using the `/` delimiter to identify folder levels). This allows you to check whether the current folder is a subfolder of any previously added folder.

5. **Check for Subfolders**:
   - If at any point during this string construction, you find that a parent folder exists in the set, it means the current folder `i` is a subfolder. In such cases, you skip this folder by breaking out of the loop.
   - If no parent folder is found, the folder is added to both the result vector and the set, indicating that it is not a subfolder.

6. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all folders, the final result contains only the top-level folders (no subfolders), which is then returned.
